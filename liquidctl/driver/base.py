    """Base driver API.

    All drivers are expected to implement this API for compatibility with the
    liquidctl CLI or other thirdy party tools.

    Drivers will automatically implement the context manager protocol, but this
    should only be used from a call to `connect`.

    Example:

        for dev in <Driver>.find_supported_devices():
            with dev.connect():
                print(dev.get_status())

                    dev.set_fixed_speed('fan3', 42)

        those scenarios, no other method, except `connect()` or `disconnect()`,
        should be called until the device and driver has been (re-)initialized.

        Returns None or a list of `(property, value, unit)` tuples, similarly

        ## Notes for driver authors

        Apart from `connect()`, some devices might require a one-time
        initialization procedure after powering on, or to detect hardware
        changes.  This should be called *after* connecting to the device.
