# Corsair HXi and RMi series PSUs
_Driver API and source code available in [`liquidctl.driver.corsair_hid_psu`](../liquidctl/driver/corsair_hid_psu.py)._

## Initialization

It is necessary to initialize the device once it has been powered on.

```
# liquidctl initialize
```

The +12V rails normally functions in multiple-rail mode, and `initialize` will
by default reset the PSU to that behavior.  Single-rail mode can be optionally
selected by passing `--single-12v-ocp` to `initialize`.

_Changed in 1.9.0: changing the OCP mode or resetting to hardware fan control
is not available when the device was initialized by the [Linux hwmon] driver._  

## Monitoring

_Changed in 1.9.0: OCP and fan control modes, as well current and total uptime,
are not available when data is read from [Linux hwmon]._  

The PSU is able to report monitoring data about its own hardware and basic
electrical variables for the input and output sides.

```

Input power and efficiency are estimated from efficiency data advertised by
Corsair in the respective HXi and RMi PSU user manuals.

## Fan speed

The fan speed is normally controlled automatically by the PSU.  It is possible to override this and set the fan to a fixed duty value using the `fan` channel.

```
# liquidctl set fan speed 90
```

This changes the fan control mode to software control and sets the minimum allowed duty value to 30%.  To revert back to hardware control, re-`initialize` the device.

## Appendix: differences in efficiency data

HXi and RMi power supply units do not report input power or current to the
host.  Yet, the efficiency data in the user manuals can sometimes result in
more conservative estimates that the input power and efficiency values iCue and
CorsairLink display.<sup>1</sup>

We believe that this is the result of the use, in those programs, of a
different set of efficiency curves, based on internal and unpublished testing.
Additionally, the manuals also do not match publicly available data submitted
for the 80 Plus certification of these PSUs.<sup>2</sup> Unfortunately, the
latter is only available for 115 V input.

At this point it is important to remember that efficiency, and consequently
power draw, are functions of more than just the total power output.  Thus, the
data in the user manuals is probably significantly less precise than it appears
to be, and we believe the same could be true for the values displayed by iCue
and CorsairLink.

Still, we encourage Corsair to make more of its efficiency data public, which
would hopefully allow liquidctl to present more precise estimates.

## Interaction with Linux hwmon drivers
[Linux hwmon]: #interaction-with-linux-hwmon-drivers

_New in 1.9.0._  

These devices are supported by the mainline Linux kernel with its
[`corsair-psu`] driver, and status data is provided through a standard hwmon
sysfs interface.

Starting with version 1.9.0, liquidctl automatically detects when a kernel
driver is bound to the device and, whenever possible, uses it instead of
directly accessing the device.  Alternatively, direct access to the device can
be forced with `--direct-access`.
