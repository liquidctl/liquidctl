<!--
Please start by describing the bug in as much detail as possible.
-->

<!--
Include which commands you executed, what was the expected behavior, and what was observed instead.
-->

<!--
Re-run all commands with the additional --debug flag, and include the complete output.  Use code blocks, delimited by lines with three backticks (```), to the show program invocation and output.
-->

<!--
In code blocks, you can use $ to indicate programs executed under your normal user; # to indicate programs executed under elevation (root/Administrator or sudo); ## to indicate comments that are not part of command output; and, sparingly, ellipsis to indicate suppressed output.
-->

<!--
```
## Any text between lines of three backticks is a code block.  Paste program
## invocations and output in here, or in other blocks like this.

$ liquidctl list --debug
