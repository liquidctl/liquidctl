# Experimental support for the NZXT Smart Device V2

The NZXT Smart Device V2 is a newer model of the original fan and LED controller. It ships with NZXT's cases released in mid-2019 including the H510 Elite, H510i, H710i, and H210i.

It provides three independent fan channels with standard 4-pin connectors. Both PWM and DC control is supported, and the device automatically chooses the appropriate mode for each channel.

Additionally, it features two independent lighting (Addressable RGB) channels, unlike the single channel in the original. NZXT Aer RGB 2 fans and HUE 2 lighting accessories (HUE 2 LED strip, HUE 2 Unerglow, HUE 2 Cable Comb) can be connected. The firmware installed on the device exposes several color presets, most of them common to other NZXT products.

HUE 2 and HUE+ devices (including Aer RGB and Aer RGB 2 fans) are supported, but HUE 2 components cannot be mixed with HUE+ components in the same channel. Each lighting channel supports up to 6 accessories and a total of 40 LEDs.

A microphone is still present onboard for noise level optimization through CAM and AI.

All configuration is done through USB, and persists as long as the device still gets power, even if the system has gone to Soft Off (S5) state.  The device also reports the state of each fan channel, as well as speed and duty (from 0% to 100%).

Most capabilities available at the hardware level are supported, but other features offered by CAM, like noise level optimization and presets based on CPU/GPU temperatures, have not been implemented.


## Initialization

After powering on from Mechanical Off, or if there have been hardware changes, the device must first be initialized. Only then monitoring, proper fan control and all lighting effects will be available.

```
# liquidctl initialize
```


## Monitoring

The device can report fan information for each channel, the noise level at the onboard sensor, as well as the type of the connected LED accessories.

```
# liquidctl status
Device 1, NZXT Smart Device V2 (experimental)
Fan 2 duty                              42  %
Fan 2 speed                            934  rpm
Firmware version                     1.5.0  
LED 1 accessory 1          HUE 2 LED Strip  
LED 1 accessory 2    HUE 2 Underglow 200mm  
LED 1 accessory 3    HUE 2 Underglow 200mm  
LED 2 accessory 1          AER RGB 2 140mm  
LED 2 accessory 2          AER RGB 2 140mm  
LED 2 accessory 3          AER RGB 2 140mm  
LED 2 accessory 4          AER RGB 2 120mm  
Noise level                             62  dB
```


## Fan speeds

Fan speeds can only be set to fixed duty values.

```
# liquidctl set fan2 speed 90
```

| Channel | Minimum duty | Maximum duty | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | - |
| fan1 | 0% | 100% ||
| fan2 | 0% | 100% ||
| fan3 | 0% | 100% ||
| sync | 0% | 100% | all available channels |

*Always check that the settings are appropriate for the use case, and that they correctly apply and persist.*


## RGB lighting

The device features two lighting channels, `led1` and `led2`, that support up to 6 lighting accessories each. Color modes can be set independently for each lighting channel. The specified color mode will then apply to all devices daisy chained on that channel.

```
# liquidctl set led1 color fixed af5a2f
# liquidctl set led1 color fading 350017 ff2608 --speed slower
# liquidctl set led2 color pulse ffffff
# liquidctl set led2 color backwards-marquee-5 2f6017 --speed slowest
```

Colors are set in hexadecimal RGB, and each animation mode supports different number of colors.  The animation speed can be customized with the `--speed <value>`, and five relative values are accepted by the device: `slowest`, `slower`, `normal`, `faster` and `fastest`.

| --- | --- | --- |
